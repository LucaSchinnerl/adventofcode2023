# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 programming puzzles. I will be solving the problems using either Rust or Python, depending on the nature of the problem and my preference at the time.

## Getting Started

To run the solutions, you will need to have Rust and Python installed on your machine.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- dayXX/: A directory for each day's problem (replace XX with the day number, e.g., day01, day02, etc.)
  - src/: Contains the Rust solution (if applicable)
    - main.rs: The Rust solution for the day's problem
  - solution.py: The Python solution for the day's problem (if applicable) 
  - input.txt: The input data for the day's problem
  - README.md: A brief description of the problem and any notes on the solution

## Running the Solutions

To run a Rust solution, navigate to the dayXX directory and run the following command:

`cargo run --release`

To run a Python solution, navigate to the dayXX directory and run the following command:

`python solution.py`
