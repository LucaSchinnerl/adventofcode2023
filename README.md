# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 programming puzzles. I will be solving the problems using Rust.

## Getting Started

To run the solutions, you will need to have Rust installed on your machine.

## Usage
```sh
cargo run --release --bin DAY # run a specific day
cargo run --release           # run all days
```
